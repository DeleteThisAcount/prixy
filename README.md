# Proxy Express

  This repo/site was made to make https://api.scratch.mit.edu/proxy/featured look better on a 3rd party safe website, for scratch users, who can't login to scratch, but can see this, or users who want a cleaner way than the white lain scratch background.
  
  This repo was made possible by one pull request, which i edited and dissused with the pull request sender. I made this, with some backup. 
  
  Lisence < For Forking and copying news.

  Thanks :3.
